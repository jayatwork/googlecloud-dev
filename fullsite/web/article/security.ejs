<p><strong>The future of P@$$W0RDs</strong></p><br>
Who isnt exhausted with keeping track of your credentials between the countless apps and sites we interact with daily???<br>
One approach would be a quick download of your favorite friendly password manager as shown below.  A more exciting thought is to completely
 reimagine what passwords are and should be in future <br>
 (if they should exist at all). <br><br>

<b>
<ol>
 <li>LastPass. The best password manager overall. </li>
 <li>Keeper. A password manager with top-notch security. ...</li>
 <li>Dashlane. The best password-manager desktop-app interface. ...</li>
 <li>1Password. Best for Mac and iOS users. ...</li>
 <li>RoboForm. Basic, but reliable and inexpensive. ...</li>
 <li>Blur. ....</li>
 <li>KeePass. ....</li>
 <li>Enpass. ....</li>
</ol></b>

“Passwords have been around since computers were invented,” said Dan DeMichele, VP product management for LogMeIn, a secure access provider. <br>
“They’re not going away, even as we create a more passwordless experience for the end user.” DeMichele said that 80 percent of breaches are the result of stolen passwords, <br>
usually the result of social engineering or phishing attacks. Other attacks, he said, are the result of brute force attacks in which the attacker uses a computer to <br>
continually guess the correct password until they’re successful. When a user reuses a password, or uses passwords with only slight variations, it makes the attacker’s job a lot easier.<br>

<b>Remembering Fewer Passwords </b><br>

One solution to all of those identical or similar passwords is to have only one, or perhaps only a few. DeMichele suggests considering a move to a single sign-on approach, in which <br>
your access is managed by a layer of software that authenticates each user, and then passes that authentication along to all of the other applications or access points using either <br>
secure handshakes, or long, complex passwords the user never sees. <br><br>

To make the single sign-on more secure, but still manageable by the IT staff, while being something that users can handle, it helps to add additional factors to the authentication process. <br>
Those factors can be smart cards such as those used by the federal government, USB security keys or biometric readers.
